     * `onSdkReady` that never came, hit the timeout, and the watch went stale while the
     * phone widget - fed by the same fetch - stayed fresh. Each `initialize()` also
     * registered another BroadcastReceiver that was never unregistered.

     * The simulator never showed it because the adb strategy calls `onSdkReady()` directly
     * inside every `initialize()`.
