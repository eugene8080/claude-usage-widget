//! Publishes the three meters as watchface complications, from whatever snapshot the phone
//! last pushed. The watch still fetches nothing itself - this only re-exposes stored numbers
//! in the complication framework so any watchface (public access) can show them.
//!
//! The framework keeps the last published value, so a watchface shows it even when this app
//! is not open. It is only as fresh as the last publish, which the background service runs on
//! a ~5-min timer from whatever the phone last pushed - the watch has no data source itself.
//!
//! (:background) because it runs inside the background service, not the foreground app.

    //! throws when a device app publishes with no live subscriber, and a device could refuse
    //! for reasons of its own. A failure here just means the watchface complications don't
    //! update this cycle - the app carries on.
