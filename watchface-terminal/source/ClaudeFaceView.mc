//! Layout comes straight from the HTML layout editor: a prompt line, the big time, the date, then
//! three CLI-style rows (5H / 1W / model) each with a bar, percentage and reset time, a segmented
//! battery bar, and a blinking cursor. Night Owl colours on black, in IBM Plex Mono. In always-on
//! the time drops to a thin outline HH:MM and the grey tracks go; the mesh / scanlines stay (see _lowPower).
//!
//! The values come from the published complications. We can't construct a custom complication's Id
//! directly (its identity is an internal UUID), so onShow ENUMERATES the available complications,
//! keeps the ones whose label marks them as ours, subscribes, and caches value + reset epoch;
//! onComplicationChange refreshes the cache. The reset time is carried in the complication's `unit`
//! field as raw epoch-seconds and formatted here.
