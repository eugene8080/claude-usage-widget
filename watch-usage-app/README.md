# Claude Usage - Garmin watch app

A glance for fenix 8 class watches, including the **tactix 8**, showing the same three meters
as the phone widget: `5H`, `1W`, and the per-model weekly cap. Each meter also shows when it
resets, as a wall-clock time the way the Claude usage menu states it - a clock time for the
5-hour session (`9:27p`), a weekday for the weekly caps (`Tue`), or a month/day once a reset
is more than a week out (`Sep 22`). Honours the watch's 12/24-hour setting.

## The watch never talks to Claude

It renders numbers pushed from the Android app over BLE, and holds nothing else. Two reasons
it must work this way, either one decisive:

- **Cloudflare.** `cf_clearance` is minted by solving a JS challenge in a real browser engine,
  which is why the phone app carries a WebView. Connect IQ's `makeWebRequest` is a plain HTTP
  client with no JS engine, so claude.ai answers it with a 403.
- **Credential blast radius.** A Claude `sessionKey` in Connect IQ `Application.Storage` is
  unencrypted, on a device worn outdoors and handed to people. On the phone it sits in
  `EncryptedSharedPreferences` behind the Android keystore.

## Device profile

`fenix847mm` **is** the tactix 8 47mm/51mm profile - Garmin ships fenix 8 / tactix 8 / quatix 8
as one Connect IQ device, which the simulator title bar confirms. There is no separate
`tactix8` profile to install.

## Build

Requires the Connect IQ SDK and a developer key (both already installed on this machine -
SDK 9.2.0 under `%APPDATA%\Garmin\ConnectIQ\Sdks`, key at `~/.garmin-keys/developer_key.der`).

```
monkeyc -f monkey.jungle -o build/ClaudeUsage.prg \
        -y ~/.garmin-keys/developer_key.der -d fenix847mm
monkeydo build/ClaudeUsage.prg fenix847mm      # loads it into a running simulator
```

## Testing the phone link without a watch

The Connect IQ simulator talks to the companion app running on an Android device **or
emulator** over adb, at simulated BLE speeds - no physical watch, and no Garmin Connect
Mobile. Verified working end to end on 2026-09-16.

```
./gradlew assembleDebug -PciqTethered=true && adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb forward tcp:7381 tcp:7381
monkeydo watch/build/ClaudeUsage-fenix847mm.prg fenix847mm
```

**Order matters, and it is the one thing that will waste your afternoon.** The phone app is
the *server*: its SDK opens port 7381 only while a push is running, and the simulator's
connect attempt does not retry. So:

1. Trigger a refresh on the phone (tap the widget). The app logs
   `ConnectIQ-AdbConnection: Waiting for simulator connection.` and the socket is now open.
   It stays open for as long as the app process lives.
2. **Then** in the simulator: **adb Connection > Start** (Ctrl-F1). It logs
   `Simulator connected`.
3. Trigger another refresh. That one lands: `Wrote N bytes to output stream` /
   `ClaudeWatch: watch updated: Simulator`.

Clicking Start first connects to nothing and looks identical to a broken bridge.

## Complications

The three meters are also published as watchface complications (ids 0/1/2 in
`resources/complications.xml`, public access so any watchface incl. Face It can show them).
Each is a percentage with a short label and colour-zone ranges; the reset time does not fit
a complication slot and stays in the glance.

**Publishing must run from a background service.** A device app that calls
`Complications.updateComplication()` from the foreground faults with an *uncatchable*
"Illegal Access (Out of Bounds)" - confirmed, and confirmed on the Garmin forums. So
`BackgroundService.mc` publishes on a temporal event (Connect IQ's 5-minute floor), which
the app registers in `onStart`. The values are whatever the phone last pushed into Storage.

Open the app once after install so `onStart` registers the temporal event; from then on the
background service republishes every ~5 minutes.

> Not verifiable in the headless simulator (the sim can't be driven to its
> Simulation > Complications viewer here, and foreground publishing faults by design).
> Confirm on a real watch by adding a Claude complication to a watchface.

## Layout note

Glance code is compiled into its own restricted memory space, so `Snapshot` and the glance
view are annotated `(:glance)`. `Snapshot`, `Publisher` and the background service are also
`(:background)` because the complication publish runs in the background context. Anything
those contexts touch needs the matching annotation.

## Cutting a release

The watch version is a manual constant in `source/Version.mc` (the `.prg` is built locally,
not by CI). Bump it to the release version, rebuild `dist/` with `monkeyc -r`, and attach the
`.prg` files to the GitHub release alongside the APK.
